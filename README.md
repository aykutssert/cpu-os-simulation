# GTU-C312 Operating System Simulator

A custom CPU simulator with a cooperative operating system implementation, demonstrating low-level systems programming, thread management, and assembly-like instruction execution.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements a complete operating system simulation for the GTU-C312 architecture - a custom CPU with a minimalist instruction set. The system features cooperative multitasking, system call handling, memory protection, and comprehensive debugging capabilities.

### Key Features
- **Custom CPU Architecture**: GTU-C312 with memory-mapped registers and specialized instruction set
- **Cooperative Operating System**: Written entirely in GTU-C312 assembly language
- **Thread Management**: Round-robin scheduling with context switching and thread isolation
- **System Call Interface**: PRN (print), HLT (halt), and YIELD operations
- **Memory Protection**: User/kernel mode separation with access control
- **Debug Framework**: Multiple debug modes for system analysis and development

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### CPU Specifications
- **Memory**: 20,000 words with dedicated regions for OS and threads
- **Registers**: Memory-mapped control registers (PC, SP, Thread ID, etc.)
- **Instruction Set**: 12 core instructions including arithmetic, control flow, and system calls
- **Memory Layout**:
  - `0-20`: OS registers and control flags
  - `21-999`: OS data and thread management tables
  - `1000-1999`: Thread 1 workspace (Bubble Sort)
  - `2000-2999`: Thread 2 workspace (Linear Search)
  - `3000-3999`: Thread 3 workspace (Sum Calculator)

### Instruction Set
```assembly
SET, CPY, CPYI, CPYI2    # Data movement
ADD, ADDI, SUBI          # Arithmetic operations
JIF                      # Conditional branching
CALL, RET                # Subroutine handling
PUSH, POP                # Stack operations
SYSCALL                  # System calls (PRN/HLT/YIELD)
USER                     # Kernel to user mode transition
```

## üßµ Thread Implementations

### Thread 1: Bubble Sort
Sorts a 4-element array `[4,2,3,1]` using bubble sort algorithm with optimized passes and cooperative yielding.

### Thread 2: Linear Search
Searches for a target value in an array using linear search with early termination and index reporting.

### Thread 3: Sum Calculator
Computes the sum of integers from 1 to N using iterative accumulation with progress printing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++ recommended)
- Make utility

### Building and Running
```bash
# Compile the simulator
make

# Run with different debug modes
./Simulate os.txt -D 0    # Memory dump at end
./Simulate os.txt -D 1    # Step-by-step memory dumps
./Simulate os.txt -D 2    # Interactive step-through
./Simulate os.txt -D 3    # Thread table dumps on context switches
```

### Debug Modes
- **Mode 0**: Complete execution with final memory state
- **Mode 1**: Memory dump after each instruction
- **Mode 2**: Interactive mode with manual stepping
- **Mode 3**: Thread table monitoring during context switches

## üîß Technical Implementation

### CPU Simulator (main.cpp)
- `GTUCPU` class encapsulating the entire simulation
- Instruction parsing and execution engine
- System call handling and mode transitions
- Thread state management and scheduling
- Memory protection and access control

### Operating System (os.txt)
- Boot sequence and system initialization
- Round-robin thread scheduler
- System call dispatcher and handlers
- Thread creation and management routines
- Context switching mechanisms

### Key Algorithms
- **Cooperative Scheduling**: Round-robin with voluntary yielding
- **System Call Handling**: Kernel/user mode transitions with parameter passing
- **Memory Management**: Protected address spaces with violation detection
- **Thread Synchronization**: Blocking/unblocking mechanisms for I/O operations
